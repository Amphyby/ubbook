# C++ programmer's guide to undefined behavior

The book (started just as a series of blogposts) is originaly written in Russian language, and this repository currenlty doesn't have full and organized translation for English

In cooperation with [PVS-studio](https://pvs-studio.com/), I'm working on extended English version. It's available as a series of 11(12) posts in PVS-studio blog

-------

**NOTE: This series may not contain some materials from the original Russian version. There were changes in sources after publication in PVS-studio blog**

C++ language is constantly evolving. I learn more facinating bugs. Get feedback and fix mistakes in text. But as a full-time employed engineer, I cannot effectively maintain & update both Russian and English versions.

Eventually, full English translation will be available in this repository.
